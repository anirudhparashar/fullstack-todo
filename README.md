## Features

- Create new tasks with a title, description, and status.
- Update the status of tasks.
- Delete tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager.git
   cd task-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the back-end:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the back-end server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Start the front-end development server:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Front-End

The front-end is built with React and includes the following components:

- `TaskForm`: Handles the creation of new tasks.
- `TaskList`: Displays the list of tasks with options to update or delete.
- `TaskItem`: Represents an individual task.
- `Filter`: Provides a dropdown to filter tasks by status.

## Back-End

The back-end is built with Node.js and Express, and it provides a RESTful API for managing tasks.

### Setting Up the Database

The application uses MongoDB for data storage. You need to set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection string in a `.env` file in the `server` directory.

Example `.env` file:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/taskmanager
PORT=5000
```
